4. purpose of cookies. 5-7 lines in 

=> Cookies are created to identify you when you visit a new website. The web server — which stores the website's data — sends a short stream of identifying info to your web browser. Browser cookies are identified and read by “name-value” pairs. These tell cookies where to be sent and what data to recall.
There are three types of computer cookies: session, persistent, and third-party. These virtually invisible text files are all very different. Each with their own mission, these cookies are made to track, collect, and store any data that companies request.

6. how javascript run ? 5-7 lines in english
=> JavaScript is an interpreted language where code is explained and executed at the runtime. Additionally, we know that web browsers understand HTML and CSS and converting those languages into a visual display on the screen. The part of the web browser that understands HTML and CSS is called the rendering engine. However, most browsers also have a JavaScript interpreter. That’s the part of the browser that understands JavaScript and run JavaScript programs.
the browser's Rendering engine interacts with the "JavaScript's Interpreter" and sends the JavaScript code to the JavaScript engine for processing.
The JavaScript engine/JavaScript Interpreter comprises both an Interpreter and a Just in Time compiler. Additionally, the overall execution of the JavaScript is a 5 step process,
1. JavaScript Engine Loads Source Code.
2. The interpreter starts the application.
3. The Compiler receives code.
4. The compiler starts optimization and compilation.
5. The compiler incrementally optimizes the code.
